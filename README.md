### Database Backups (S3)

If you configure the S3 variables in `.env`, the system will automatically:
- Create a `backup` sidecar container.
- Perform a **Hot Backup** of CockroachDB (SQL Dump) every 6 hours.
- Perform an incremental backup of MinIO files.
- Upload everything to your S3 bucket using Restic (encrypted and deduplicated).

#### Manual Backup
To trigger an immediate backup:
```bash
docker exec -it <project>-backup-1 /scripts/backup-daemon.sh
```

#### Restore
To restore from the latest S3 snapshot:
```bash
# STOPS services to ensure data consistency
docker compose run --rm backup restore
# Then restart
docker compose restart
```

## ✨ Key Features

This configuration has been modernized and enhanced by our team:
- **Reinforced Security**: Public registration disabled by default (`DISABLE_SIGNUP=true`). Your instance is only accessible to those you invite.
- **Custom Mail Service**: Includes a Node.js-based mail service (`mail-service`) that resolves authentication incompatibilities and ensures invitations always reach their destination.
- **Modern Architecture**: Native support for CockroachDB, Redpanda, MinIO, and Elasticsearch.
- **Optimized for Dokploy**: Automatic integration with Traefik and volume management.

## 🚀 Hardware Requirements

For a smooth operation of all services:
* **RAM**: Minimum **4GB** (8GB recommended for production).
* **CPU**: 2 Cores or more.
* **Storage**: SSD recommended.

## 🛠️ Dokploy Installation Guide

### 1. Server Preparation
It is **CRITICAL** to increase the memory map limit for Elasticsearch. Run on your host server:
```bash
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```
*(Make it persistent by editing `/etc/sysctl.conf`)*.

### 2. Dokploy Setup
1.  Create a new project and select the **"Compose"** deployment type.
2.  **Docker Compose**: Copy the content from our [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml).
3.  **Environment Variables**: Use our [`.env.example`](./.env.example) as a template. Make sure to configure:
    - `HOST_ADDRESS`: Your domain (e.g., `huly.yourdomain.com`).
    - `SMTP_*`: Your credentials from your **SMTP mail provider**.
    - `SECRET`: A random and secure string.
